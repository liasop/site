          Around noon we got sandwiches from Rhea's deli and went to dolores with Nat and Claire. The deli was great, I'm surprised we 
          haven't tried it yet. They had a bunch of options, and I got the valencia st.

          Later, I made shortbread cookies from Sohla's cookbook to bring to Nana's the next day. The recipe was very easy and I thought
          they turned out well, just a bit sweet. Luckily there are a lot of mods and different options you can do, I think next 
          time I might cut back on the crumble and also use a more sour or bitter filling.

          Even better on day 2!
