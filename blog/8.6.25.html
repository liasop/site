          Today I went with Jordan to a yoga class taught by Grace. George DJ'd in the sauna garden
          afterwards. It was a cool space, very new. The sauna was very nice. A perfect
          pre-Outsidelands activity. The yoga class by Grace was also very nice, she 
          has a specific style that I like and I remember doing specific poses only
          from her classes.
