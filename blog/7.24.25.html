            Today was my sister's birthday :) happy Birthday Mara!

             For the month of July we are completely remote for one of my jobs, so normally I would go into the office on Thursdays but instead I hung out with my office mate Kurt all day and worked.

            I'm entering a new running era so I also went on a run. By the time I got to dolores on the way back my inner thigh was barking at me, so it was a walk from that point on. Dolores was beautiful though! Not pictured: people larping (one had a foam ball on a chain!!)

            While I was doing some laundry in the evening in the washroom, this was my view of Bernal Hill. I love how all of the little windows look with their warm glowing lights.           </p>
