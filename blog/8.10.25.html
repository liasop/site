          Day 3 of Outside Lands! We were out of half n half so Kurt and I got coffees at Ritual. It feels like a special luxury to 
          go out in the mornings on a weekend since I'm usually working. This was a nice way to debrief the past two days and 
          start the day on a nice note.

            I have a few nice pictures of Kurt and Mia from today, but still feeling a bit unsure about if I'd like to have 
            pictures of faces here. Anyways I got a shot of the lit up trees before the Jamie xx set. Today was lovely, a great way 
            to close out the weekend with dancing, laughter, easy times.
