Today I went with Jordan to a yoga class taught by Grace. George DJ'd in the sauna garden
afterwards. It was a cool space, very new. The sauna was very nice. A perfect
pre-Outsidelands activity. The yoga class by Grace was also very nice, she 
has a specific style that I like and I remember doing specific poses only
from her classes.
