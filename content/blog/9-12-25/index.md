This morning I saw a bunch of little rabbits on my run vibing on the sidewalk. They all had tiny white tails.

After the annual meeting I had a meeting in San Jose where I was truly on my last leg. I tried to turn lemons into lemonade though becuase I happened to be near an Oakley's outlet and I had been meaning to try some on. I was so hungry because I accidently missed lunch and got this dinner at the food court in the mall. I ate this whole thing.

The eye jacket. I didn't get these but they are a vibe.
