Day two of Portola! Sadly did not get many pictures at all. Rico Nasty was a great set, she's so talented and I love her energy. She got the crowd so excited and feeling themselves. We love it! Also we united the groups around this time, which was kind of here and there but always nice to do.

Overall lovely Portola experience, I would say the line up was maybe not my absolute favorite this year, but that meant there was a lot of space for other energies and priorities. It was fun running into so many people, and felt very serendipitous. bye bye party people.
