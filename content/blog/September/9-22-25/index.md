The only photo I have from today is of this little mushroom I saw in Jury commons park while waiting for the laundry. I think today was mostly recovering and doing laundry, and then later we met up at Zeitgeist for drinks to say goodbye to Breadbelly people. It was sweet and fun and nice for Kurt to meet them.
