Pushed off from Joshua tree and stopped at this coffee shop mas o menos reccomended by Anil. It was a bit of an out and back but I thought it was worth it for the iced latte.

I think at this point I had kind of forgotten about the blog and trying to take pictures and was just kind of in my experience. But I think Kurt was starting to really feel sick this day, and we drove all the way through Las Vegas up to BLM land near Zion.

This feature was super interesting I thought. Its kind of hard to see in the photo, but the land all tilts very flat into the valley, and then theres little spots of mountains. It looks like another planet to me more than anything I've seen.
