I think I was starting to feel better this day after a good sleep. We decided to check out the Jumbo rocks area and a little nature hike overby there. It was getting toasty even early in the day.

I liked this cool dead tree with nothing much around it.

The dead trees take a long time to decompose I think and get all dried out from the sun. Some of them were very twisty like this one.

Little protected area that was cool closer to our campsite.
