After work (last work for a while!) Kurt and I walked to dolores before going out to the Salute pre-party. I liked this tree with a wide base and palm-like leaves.

Dolores sunset. It was interesting going out after- I realized that its been a long time since I've really been out later than 8pm on a Friday. The city is so alive with people on the weekends.
