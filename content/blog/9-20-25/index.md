Day one of Portola! As Kurt and I were walked to Sami-ramis to get hummus we walked down the car show that was happening on Mission. Turns out this is the year for them. It looked like a lot of fun, and the cars looked very slick.

Kurt made a mineragua ad for our pre-game :') It was nice to have people over and eat pizza and hang out before walking in. Our apartment is very convenient becuase its literally right where the shuttles pick up. We also stopped by the candy shop, in part to check it out and support as we've been meaning to, and also to get some lolipops. Kurt had a vision of licking a giant lolipop in the set, and this vision was partially realized.

I didn't get many photos but I did get this not very good one of Christina Aguilera! She was incredible.
