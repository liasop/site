Three for three beautiful sunrise images this long weekend :)

Staff meal today, a regular guest brought dim sum which in theory was dank but this sesame ball really did me in after a long day with Clem on the bar. Clem kept saying today "we need to be in synchronicity" which was very chaotic and silly.

We had one banana cake left after service!! Last solider left standing.

Here is the shaved ice machine that Clem is all excited about. No shaved ice for customers today though. We did get to test the potential dish out today though and it was tasty.

After this Jimmy threw a snowball made of shaved ice at Clem.
