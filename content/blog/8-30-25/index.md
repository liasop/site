First thing I see when I wake up and go to the kitchen in the early morn! I was super tired this morning bc I was in Oakland celebrating a Birthday the night before, and it took me a little while to fall asleep after. So this was nice to wake up to.

Clem is testing using his new ice shaver machine. I've been asking about it a lot and maybe encouraging him to get it up and running hehe. Today we tested the plums he's been preparing, and the vanilla cream with the shaved ice from the new machine. Kelsi thought it was too sour, but I think I got some sweeter plums. I think it needs nuts or something. But its good!
