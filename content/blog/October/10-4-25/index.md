Today it rained all day, the most rain SLC airport has seen since 1901 apparently. As such it was a pretty relaxed day we spent mostly inside. I started a TV show, Undone, reccomended by Claire and was really enjoying it. We went for a walk after dinner when it finally started drying up a bit to an overlook.

The houses in the upper avenues are wild. This one had a glowing yellow cube.
