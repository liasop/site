Kurt and I went on an early walk today and saw these little pods on this tree. They look like edamame!

A lots of leaves fell maybe because of the rain and are carpeting the ground in some areas on the trails behind Kurt's parent's house.

Later we went to Publik, they have a nice upstairs with quiet rooms. Its nice to be somewhere where not every square inch of space is so expensive and sought after, and where you can have something like this that isn't just completely overrrun with remote workers.
