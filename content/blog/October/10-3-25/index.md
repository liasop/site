After a big dinner and wine and aeperol spritz I didn't sleep too well and wanted to go running first thing in the foothills. It was super beautiful, golden light and a few sprinkles. Lots of mountain bikers, but they are nice.

Saw these little bumps on all of the scrub oaks. I wonder what bug this is.
