Day 2 of Outside Lands! We caught a ride to the festival today after a baby shower pre-game. 
Some different energy at the festival today, maybe less nervousness that can go with day 1. I liked 
seeing all the people sitting at different moments, and the little pockets of the festival 
that I hadn't seen yet.
This was at Good Neighbours.

Ended the night with Vampire Weekend. There was one part of the set where they took requests from the crowd, non-Vampire Weekend songs.
Very fun and brave and shows how talented the group is.
