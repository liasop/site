Outside Lands day one!!! Here's a pic of Kurt inflating his bike tire
before we left for the big adventure. Biking there was lovely 10/10. The 
weather is beautiful this weekend and biking is so chill and peaceful.

John Summit!! We met up with Mia, Joe and Taylor to see him.
We saw a sign "John Summie makes me Kummie"
